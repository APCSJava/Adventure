/**
*  Example of an Object Oriented Programming Resource class
*
*  In this coding pattern, objects are viewed as a collection of STATE and BEHAVIOR.  
*
*  When instantiated (created) each instance will have its initial state set, according to one
*  or more constructors.  This state is kept hidden from outside classes by designating the data 
*  fields as "private", thus preventing direct access.  Instead, outside classes are required 
*  to manipulate each instance only through its publicly exposed methods.  This approach is 
*  referred to as the principle of DATA ENCAPSULATION.
